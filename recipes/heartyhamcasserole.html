    <h5><em>This ham and beans recipe was created by my mom, and I really enjoyed it as a child. As an adult, my taste changed just a bit, so I modified her recipe to kick it up a bit. It is fabulous even though the ingredients list is quite short! This is a must-make with leftover ham and everyone agrees it's absolutely delicious.</em></h5>
