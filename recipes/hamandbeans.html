    <h5><em>This ham and beans recipe was created by my mom, and I really enjoyed it as a child. As an adult, my taste changed just a bit, so I modified her recipe to kick it up a bit. It is fabulous even though the ingredients list is quite short! This is a must-make with leftover ham and everyone agrees it's absolutely delicious.</em></h5>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound dry great Northern beans</li>
        <li>½ pound cooked ham, diced</li>
        <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
        <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>6 cups water, or as needed to cover</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>    
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse beans; transfer to a large stockpot. Cover with cold water and let stand overnight or at least 8 hours. Drain and rinse beans.</li>
        <li>Return beans to stockpot; add ham, onion, sugar, parsley, and cayenne pepper. Pour in enough water to cover and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until beans are tender, adding more water if needed, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.</li>
